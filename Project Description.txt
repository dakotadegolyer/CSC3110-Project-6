Project 6
Given a set of vertices, and a set of edges in an adjacency list, determine all existing cycles (if any) in a
directed graph.
Example
Input
Vertices (as an array of strings within the program)
vertices = { ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’}
Adjacency list (as an array of linked lists)
list=
A -> (B, 18) -> (C, 14) -> (E, 16)
B -> (C, 2) -> (D, 10)
C -> (E, 6)
D -> (A, 3) -> (C, 15) -> (E, 11)
E -> (C, 17)
Output
Cycles (as an array of lists within the program)
cycles=
[ {“A”, “B”, “D”},
{“C”, “E”} ]
There are many possible outcomes, since a cycle could start in any of its vertex members, and the list of
cycles could start in any cycle e.g.
cycles=
[ {“C”, “E”},
{“B”, “D”, “A”} ]
The cycle list above is valid (other valid solutions are not shown). Your solution only needs to find one of
the valid solutions.
Also, notice the vertex list is not a set (where member order is not relevant) but a sequence (where
order matters).
On the other hand, the cycle list is a set (where the order between cycles is not relevant).
